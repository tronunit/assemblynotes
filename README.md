## notes on assembly language
Still in draft stage!

There are a lot of tutorials out there that go over a lot of basic stuff. There is simply so much 'beginning stuff' that it's hard to get into the actual code/ intermediate beginner stuff...

* I have found myself reading lots of tutorials that never actually get to the point I am at.
* Sometimes the one sentance you need in a reference requires massive detective work to find
* I am coming back to working with asm after + a year and I forgot where the good stuff is, so this time I am storing it here

## In this repo: 
PDFs of worksheets
* These are printable, in black and white unless stated in name of the file
* Currently I have one for the stack and the registers. 
* I am working on some that cover various instruction types (These are not up yet

Once I get a good number of pdfs and .s files I may separate out the pdfs into their own repo
* some markdown drafts of info are also in here
A skeleton file that I am using as scratch right now, while I figure out what directives are ideal is also up there
* I am planning to put some heavily commented examples up there

*****
I am putting a lot of info in the wiki. (Meaning hit the 'wiki' tab above) I am trying to keep the stuff that's more curated other resources over there, and keeping stuff I have made over here. 
## the wiki has:
* info on ARM: family vs architecture, links to manuals
* raspberry pi info/resources 
* rpi operating systems
* a list of assembly language/rpi tutorials organized by what version of the pi they are on
* I plan to put a page for system call reference links, c language links, etc


****
* Currently working on ARM, armv7 (32 bit) with a raspberry pi 3 B, running raspian, and a samsung arm chromebook (snow neptune) with Arch, also armv7.
* I use gcc, gdb, vim, tmux, radare2, various text editors. 
* I also have a side side project looking at powerpc assembly on a ~2004 ibook with a g3
* I have also worked with x86, x64, but am trying to stay focused!
