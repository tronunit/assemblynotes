notes on assembly language
Still in draft stage!

This is not an introductory tutorial. It's not actually a tutorial :)
It's the things I have found that were missing from other tutorials and references, along with a collection of resouces that have helped me.
I intend to add some 'assembly language coloring book' style printables but they are currently in a very rough stage of development. 


TODO: fix skeleton (boiler plate) starter file, example outline file
TODO: add diagrams. (Have a lot of pen and paper diagrams I am working on making printable versions of)

WIP
Wiki section with resources
Collected resources from learning assembly languages, with a little c on the side

Currently working on ARM, armv7 (32 bit) with a raspberry pi 3 B, running raspian, and a samsung arm chromebook (snow neptune) with arch. I use gcc, gdb, vim, tmux, radare2, various text editors. 

I tend to have too many side projects going, so I am trying to keep the focus of this one on ARM (in the above situations) until I remember a good chunk of ARM assembly.
I also have a circa 2004 ibook with a g3 powerpc processor, running osX tiger (or whatever the last version you can have on ppc is) 

Including resources on x86, 64, various RISC family assemblers (mips, ppc)

Also interested in web assembly, bytecode, binary analysis, static analysys, compilers, interpreters, programming language implementation/design/etc, system programming, linux, unix, *nix, etc.
