## notes on assembly language
Still in draft stage!

* Currently working on ARM, armv7 (32 bit) with a raspberry pi 3 B, running raspian, and a samsung arm chromebook (snow neptune) with Arch, also armv7.
* Have just started using code::blocks with gcc, which was pretty painless to set up. Frontend for gdb. I haven't worked out how to get syntax highlighting.
* So far only atom and visual studio code have some arm assembly syntax highlighting that I have found.
* I use gcc, gdb, vim, tmux, radare2, various text editors. 

     
## most actual assembly source is in the other repo(s)

## In this repo: 
PDFs of worksheets
* so far not amazing
* These are printable, in black and white unless stated in name of the file.
* Currently I have one for the stack and the registers. These are just simple diagrams so far
* I am working on some that cover various instruction types (These are not up yet)

Once I get a good number of pdfs and .s files I may separate out the pdfs into their own repo
* some markdown drafts of info are also in here
A skeleton file that I am using as scratch right now, while I figure out what directives are ideal is also up there
* I am planning to put some heavily commented examples up there

*****
I am putting a lot of info in the wiki. (Meaning hit the 'wiki' tab above) I am trying to keep the stuff that's more curated other resources over there, and keeping stuff I have made over here. 
## the wiki has:
* info on ARM: family vs architecture, links to manuals
* raspberry pi info/resources 
* rpi assmebly tutorials online by rpi version
* rpi operating systems
* a list of assembly language/rpi tutorials organized by what version of the pi they are on
* I plan to put a page for system call reference links, c language links, etc
* Some related books I have read
